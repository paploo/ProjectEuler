Problem:

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44
8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44
As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.


Solution:

The very first hit I got when trying to do some research for any hint, happend to
have a list of numbers that fit the given property:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NarcissisticNumber.html

[54748, 92727, 93084].inject(:+) = 240559

But this wasn't it. This is because the definition only counts n-digit numbers.
But when, a few links later, I saw the same numbers in a bigger list, I figured
I had it:

http://library.thinkquest.org/C005972/html/other_numbers/beauty/4.htm

And sure enough, I did:

[4150, 4151, 54748, 92727, 93084, 194979].inject(:+) = 443839

It wasn't my intention to cheat, but rather I found the solution during the
course of searching for a property to exploit to get to a solution faster!
