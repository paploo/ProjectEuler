This is my repository of Project Euler solutions.  (http://projecteuler.net/)

I've divided the directories per language first, and problem number second.
Additionally, many problems can depend on the same core functionality, in which
case lib (or other appropriately named) directories will sprout up under each
language.

It is my intention to solve many problems in various languages in order to
learn more about those languages.  When a problem is obvious to me, however,
I will most likely only solve it in whichever language I can work in most
quickly.
