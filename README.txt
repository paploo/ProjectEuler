This is my repository of Project Euler solutions.  (http://projecteuler.net/)

I've divided the directories per language first, and problem number second.
Additionally, many problems can depend on the same core functionality, in which
case lib (or other appropriately named) directories will sprout up under each
language.

It is my intention to solve many problems in various languages in order to
learn more about those languages.  When a problem is obvious to me, however,
I will most likely only solve it in whichever language I can work in most
quickly.


Ruby

This is the main language in which I am solving problems.  This is because I
know the language well, so I can focus on solving the problem rather than
how to implement the solution in a given language.


Erlang

I've got weak Erlang experience and want gain more experience by doing these
problems.


C

On occasion I'll implement a problem in C.  This is either because my solution
needs a much faster language than Ruby, or because it presents a challenge when
implemented within C.
