On some occasions I'll implement a solution in C, either because my solution
needs more speed that Ruby can offer, or because the problem presents a
challenge in C that I want to try to solve.

Building:

1. First, one needs to go into lib and run make.
2. Go into the problem you want to run and run make.
3. Run the executable (usually main.out).
